# Websocket Code Editor

This is a simple code editor that allows you to run Python code.
The way it runs code is through Docker container, so potentially malicious code can be contained within Docker

As of now this is only the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), but I do have plans to improve it a little bit, after I take a little break from this project

# Plans for MVP

1. Code refactor
1. Custom text editor with syntax highlighting
1. Access to code only through account creation
1. Storage of room's content within a database
1. Final (I hope so) code refactor
